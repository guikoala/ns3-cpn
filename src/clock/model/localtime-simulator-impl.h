/**
 *  \ingroup simulator
 * 
 * @brief Implementation of single process simulator based on node local time.
 * The main differences between LocalTimeSimulatorImpl and DefaultSimulatorImpl are: 

    *  When an event is scheduled using Simulator::Schedule() function, the delay is understood as being a local-time delay. 
    The delay is then translated into a global-time delay before being inserted into the scheduler (the scheduler only operates in the global-time domain.
    * When a clock model is updated, LocalTimeSimulatorImpl keeps track of the events that have been rescheduled, and will not execute the old events.

  When Simulator::Schedule() is called, the Node object  is retrieved from the NodeList using the current context of the simulator. 
  When the context do not correspond to any node, delays are considered to be in global time.

  When Simulator::ScheduleWithContext (uint32_t context, const Time &delay, EventImpl *event) no further actions are taken. the delay is considered 
  to be in global time. This is because when a call to ScheduleWithContext happen, is due to a packet transmission within the channel. 
  The delay in that call is normally the channel transmission time (As in CsmaNetDevice), which does not depend on the nodes clock. Because of that, 
  this function remain unchanged in comparison with the DefaultSimulatorImpl function.

  When Simulator::ScheduleWithContext() is called, the same actions as in DefaultSimulatorImpl are taken. 
  The delay is understood as being already a global-time delay.

  When Simulator::ScheduleNow() is called, a call to Schedule() function with local-time delay 0 is done.

  One of the things to take into account is that Simulator::Now()  returns the current global time and not the local time.
  Another particularity of this implementation resides in the CancelEventsMap map located in LocalTimeSimulatorImpl. When events are 
  rescheduled, old events id (as key) with their corresponding new events (as value) are inserted in this map. As explained in the LocalClock 
  section, we cannot use  Simulator::Cancel() to remove old events or their implementation would be lost.
  In order not to execute events that should not be invoked (because the execution time attach to the event does not correspond to the new clock of
  the node), ProcessOneEvent() function is slightly modifyied and checks the CancelEventsMap. 
  If the EventId that is going to be executed is found as the map key, the event is skipped.

  Other problem arises from the fact that the original event is never again valid, when rescheduling events. Any process (i.e Applications) that 
  schedule events will never realize about the change of EventId due to the rescheduling. Therefore, there is a need to map between the original 
  events and the reschedule events.
