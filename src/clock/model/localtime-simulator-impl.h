/**
 *  \ingroup simulator
 * 
 * @brief Implementation of single process simulator based on node local time.
 * This class slighly differ from the default simulator implementation.
 * The purpose of this class is to provide to the simulator the capanility to manage different timing references
 * within the nodes of the network.
 * This class provide the posibility to schedule events with different notion of time and to reschedule events
 * when clock update happens during the simulation.
 * For that a new functionality is provide to the Schedule function. Note that ScheduleWithContext function remain the same a in the defaultsimulatorImpl.
 * This is because in the mayority of the times a calle to ScheduleWithContext happen, is due to a packet transmission within the channel. The delay that 
 * is introduced in that call is normally the channel transmission time (As in CsmaNetDevice), which doesn't depend on the node clock. Because of that, 
 * this function remain unchanged. 
 * 
 * Schedule function allows to retrieve from the conext the node that is scheduling the events. After retrieving the node, the Localclock object 
 * is accessed trhough the aggregation system. This new functionality, is just possible if a LocalClock object has been aggregated before to the node.
 * It permits to attach to each in the simulation different time notions.
 * Context with number 4294967295 that are set after application stop events are skiped.
 * 
 *  This class also provide the posibilty to the nodes to cancel events due to a clock update event. Imagine that a node receive a clock update 
 * message. All the events that has been scheduled by that node need to be reschedule at the proper time. This class maintains a list of cancel events 
 * by the nodes. Node don't cancell the events directly because if Simulator::Cancel () or Simulator::Destory() there is no way to recover the event 
 * implementation. This has been done in this way becuase the base code of EventImpl doesn't provide a copy contructor. 
 * So, ones the eventImpl is cancell there is no way that the event can be reschedule. 
 * To over come from that situation, the simulator maintains a list with all the cancelled events by the nodes. When procesing an event, the simulator checks
 * first if the event has been cancelled. If yes it discard the event, if not it execute.
