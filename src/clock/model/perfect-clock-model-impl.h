 * @brief This class represents a perfect clock modelling. 
 * The mapping between the local time and global time is set by an affine function.
 * The slope of the function is determined by the frequency value differece. So if for example the frequency is set to 2.
 * Local clock will be two times slower that the global time. When local time says 2 global time will be saying 4.
 * Also a initial offest is possible to set up. So LT = f*GT + offset
